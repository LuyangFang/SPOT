# SPOT: An Active Learning Framework for Deep Neural Networks

**This repository contains code for the paper "SPOT: An Active Learning Framework for Deep Neural Networks"**


## Overview

We introduce the **SPOT** algorithm, a novel active learning algorithm that integrates space-filling (SP) designs with the optimal transport (OT) technique.
SPOT utilizes optimal transport to effectively manage data from complex manifolds by mapping it to a uniformly distributed hypercube. Additionally, the space-filling design facilitates a faster asymptotic convergence rate, ensuring that the selected subset encompasses the entire dataset more effectively than other sampling methods, such as random sampling.


## Tutorial

The `SPOT_func` function in [util.R](https://github.com/Luyang8991/SPOT/blob/main/code/util.R) provides an implementation of the SPOT algorithm to select a subset of points from a given dataset. By integrating optimal transport mapping and space-filling designs, this method ensures the selected subset preserves the structure and diversity of the original data.

**key features**
- Utilizes optimal transport to map data to a uniform hypercube.
- Employs MaxPro space-filling designs for efficient subset selection.
- Supports 2D visualization for an intuitive understanding of the subset selection process.
- Handles optional true labels to display class distributions in the selected subset.


### Arguments
- `data`: The input dataset (matrix or dataframe). Each row represents a data point, and each column is a feature.
- `d`: Dimensionality of the dataset (number of columns in `data`).
- `shot`: The desired size of the subset to be selected.
- `true_label`: (Optional) A vector of true labels for the data points. Used for visualization purposes (default: NA).
- `seed`: Random seed for reproducibility (default: 2022).
- `plot`: Boolean flag to enable visualization for 2D datasets (default: FALSE).


### Requirement

The function is built on R version 4.1.1. The [requirement.txt](https://github.com/Luyang8991/SPOT/blob/main/requirements.txt) file lists all the packages the notebook depends on. 


### How to use

A demonstration of the SPOT algorithm is available in the [SPOT_demo.Rmd](https://github.com/Luyang8991/SPOT/blob/main/code/SPOT_demo.Rmd). This file provides step-by-step guidance and usage examples, including detailed visualizations for 2D datasets.

If your data is 2D, set plot = TRUE to generate visualizations of the subset selection process. The plots include:
- Original data distribution.
- Data mapped to a uniform hypercube using OT.
- Selected space-filling points in the hypercube.
- Selected subset in the original dataset.


### Function Workflow

**Key Steps:**
1. Generate Uniform Reference Data:
 - The function creates a uniform reference dataset in a $d$-dimensional hypercube to serve as the target for optimal transport mapping.
2. Optimal Transport Mapping:
 - The input data is mapped to the uniform reference using optimal transport, ensuring structure-preserving alignment.
3. Space-Filling Design:
 - A subset of points is selected from the uniform hypercube using the MaxPro space-filling design, ensuring optimal coverage.
4. Nearest Neighbor Mapping:
 - The selected points in the uniform hypercube are mapped back to the original dataset using nearest neighbor search.
5. Visualization:
 - For 2D datasets, intuitive visualizations illustrate the selection process, helping users understand how the subset was generated.
